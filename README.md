# ApartmentRegistry

My JavaFX project for CSC 331. We used Java, JavaFX, Scenebuilder, and FXML to create this application.

I wrote all the code for this application and designed most of the UI, but my team helped me come up with some of the ideas and UI designs. Our team recieved a 98.5 on this project (We lost 1.5 points for going over the time limit during our presentation).

A video demonstration of this application can be found here -> [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15G-TWfu5fp1i1xw_8PorJeKsSDKfOpqh/view?usp=sharing)
