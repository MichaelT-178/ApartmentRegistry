This my groups JavaFX project for CSC 331 in Spring 2023. We used Java, JavaFX, Scenebuilder, and FXML to create this application.

I wrote 100% of the code for this project (ignore the author tags) and designed most of the UI. My team members helped me come up with some of the ideas and UI designs. Our team received a 98.5 on this project (We lost 1.5 points for going over the time limit during our presentation).

The python files weren't part of the final grade, they we're just used to create and analyze the "database" txt files.
