This my groups JavaFX project for CSC 331. We used Java, JavaFX, Scenebuilder, and FXML to create this application.

I wrote all of the code for this project and designed most of the UI, but my team helped me come up with some of the ideas and UI designs. Our team recieved a 98.5 on this project (We lost 1.5 points for going over the time limit during our presentation).

The python files weren't part of the final grade, they we're just used to create and analyze the "database" txt files.
